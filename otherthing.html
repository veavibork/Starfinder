Even so, in crowded cities you might find a few people living her under overpasses, in culverts, or even in abandoned vehicles."],

Many of these have suffered from some environmental calamity that makes even the homeless and dispossessed stay away. Those who live here, if it can be called living, eke out a bare existence far from the mainstream society. There are no services here, not even water or electricity. Garbage collection stopped long ago. What few wild animals remain in the world tend to congregate here, and the residents are nearly, if not more, feral."],

Often the machinery remains behind long after the people have left. These rusted hulks provide a source of scrap metal for slummers, as well as the occasionally useful bit. Rarely boxes or even shipping containers of valuable and not yet fully decayed goods can be found.

The automated vehicle control system is entirely broken down and cars are being routed into circles or onto to collision courses. Adding to the mayhem, the municipal signage display false messages, wrong directions, or just laughing emojis."],

Often this takes the form of attempts to hack into servers and other data caches and scoop out the juicy data inside.

Protests are usually allowed to carry on as a means of releasing pent up tensions, a means of identifying leaders of opposition groups, or a bit of street theatre when the cops come in and start a crackdown. At times local government might be so apathetic they allow a protest to carry on. Then again, maybe the leaders here the voice of the people and are motivated to action.  Protesters tend to focus on what they are doing, and bystanders tend to watch the protest. Expect crowds, noise, and signage being carried along. Merging with the protest can be a fine way to lose a tail or move unnoticed."],

The police are surely on their way and a crackdown will certainly occur in the near future."],

Officers are stationed at every street corner, APCs armed with crowd control weapons are deployed on major roads, and command centers complete with pre-fabricated detention pens have been erected. Usually the police come in on one edge of the area, establish a fortified beachhead, and start sweeping building to building. They are not just in the streets; they are entering buildings and pulling people out. Anyone seen in the area is likely to be stopped, disarmed, and interrogated. The unlucky are sent to a detention pen for further processing."],

Stop and frisks are common, those entering who are not familiar to the local beat cops or who look like possible threats will have their papers checks and their purposes questioned. Regular random sweeps by heavily armed law enforcement officers round up any on the streets and bring them in for processing, questioning, and some light civil rights violating. A strict curfew is in place and anyone on the streets after dark is likely to get arrested.  Restrictions are usually enacted to avert the risk of riots or other civil unrest."]
